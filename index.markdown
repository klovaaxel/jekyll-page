## About me

I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). I am a member of the [Database Research Group](https://dbgroup.cs.ubc.ca/) and I am supervised by [Prof. Margo Seltzer](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/margo-seltzer). My research interests are in the area of database systems, with a focus on data management for machine learning. I am also interested in data visualization and data science. I received my BSc in Computer Science from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).
